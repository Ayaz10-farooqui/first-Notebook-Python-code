# Data Science Tools and Ecosystem
In this notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized.

Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:
ordered list:
1. Python
2. SQL
3. R

Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:
ordered list: 
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib

# Data Science Tools
1. Jupyter Notebook
2. RStudio
3. Apache Zeppelin

### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python:
1. (+) is for addition,
2. (-) is for subtraction,
3. (*) is for multiplication,
4. / is for regular division (result is always a float),
5. ** is for exponentiation,
6. // is for floor division (integer result),
7. % is for modulus (remainder of the division).


```python
x = (3*4)+5
print(x)
#  This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers
```

```python
minutes = 200
hours = minutes/60
print(hours)
# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60
```
